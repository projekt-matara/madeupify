This is purely for demo use in an article made to teach about PM2. 

It does nothing but say "Hello World" when it receives a request. Nothing more.

1. git clone the app
2. yarn install
3. ``` node app.js ``` or if you have nodemon ``` npm start ```

Otherwise this will just be part of playing with PM2.
